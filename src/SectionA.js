              Overall the essence of interior design will always be about people
              and how they live. It is about the realities of what makes for an
              attractive, civilized, meaningful environment, not about fashion
              or what's in or what's out. Decorating is not about making stage
              sets, it's not about making pretty pictures for the magazines,
              it's really about creating a quality of life, a beauty that
              nourishes the soul.
